The Rmarkdown files `Epi_VivIDEpi_one_ring_to_rule_them_all.Rmd ` and `Spatial_VivIDEpi_one_ring_to_rule_them_all.Rmd` knit together the various pieces of the epidemiologic and spatial analyses, respectively. The analysis folder contains the individual scripts, which follow a conventional numbering system for order in which they are to be run. 


Due to data privacy considerations relating to the Demographic Health Survey, the molecular PCR results generated and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.
